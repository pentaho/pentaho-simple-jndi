<!-- Sample configuration file - rename to kettle-password-encoder-plugins.xml and place in classpath.

  - To use your own implementation, change the classname to your implementation of a TwoWayPasswordEncoderInterface.
  - To use a different file name, set the KETTLE_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGINS_FILE environment variable.  The xml file must
    still exist on the classpath.
  - To implement more than one encoder, add multiple <password-encoder-plugin> nodes with different ids.  The ids are
    case insensitive.
  - Pentaho will use the "Kettle" id by default to change this to another id, set the KETTLE_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN
    to the Id you want to use.
